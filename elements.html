												<h1>My Project Idea<br />
												</h1>
												<p>Overview</p>
												<p>For my project, I would like to create an app that would primarily be used by furniture depot or an individual thinking about purchasing furniture for their home but not sure how it would look or fit in a certain area. In the final product, the user should be able to scan a specific room or area and pick what type of furniture they would like to place there (for example, a Dining Table), which will then allow the app to create an artificial image and show the user if there is enough space and how a specific furniture/equipment would look by providing a live image of the area with the product placed in it. If there is insufficient space, the App will issue a warning and begin a new scan. To find the best fit, the user will also be able to add colour coordination’s. The user will have the option to add items in their cart and later purchase it if they wish to. I am aware some individuals are not as tech conscious as others, that’s why the app will also have a page with instructions and a small tutorial at the start with images and videos, making it easy for all users to use. </p>

															<p>Motivation </p>
															<p>I decided to do this project primarily because my family recently purchased new furniture, and the main question that was either discussed in the family or asked by the salesperson was "would this fit in the room you want to put it in?" or "what are the colour schemes of the room for which you're purchasing this product?" That's when the concept for my project struck me. The concept began with the thought, "What if there was an app that had all of the available furniture uploaded by a specific furniture store?" This would allow customers to buy a product with confidence, knowing it will look good and fit in their home. Overall, I believe it will be a beneficial application in the retail industry, saving a significant amount of money, resources, and time.

																				<p>Description </p>
																				<p>	I have decided to call my application, interiorise. Interiorise is mainly AR technologies related. Interiorise will allow its users to either add or take a live photo of a certain room and then give them the opportunity to furnish it with different interior design elements such as change wall colours, experiment with light, add and remove curtains, furniture items, etc. Interiorises main purpose would be to allow its users to add different type of furniture (for example, a Coffee table) in the room they have chosen, I have decided to call this the AR Feature. The application will provide the user with measurements of the product they have chosen to place in the room which would give them a broader idea of how it will fit and look. Interiorise will allow its users to purchase the product or have the option to add it to cart or even wish list. The product will stay in their cart for 24-hours after the allowed timeframe the product will automatically be deleted from the cart. The application will have an option for a quick tutorial video or a picture tutorial making it easy to use for all ages. Interiorise will be a cloud-based system which would allow users to make an account, which they can use to buy products or rate items they have previously bought (star ratings 1-5 and leave a comment if they wish to). It will also allow the user to use the AR Feature. The cloud feature will allow Interiorises partners to add or remove products up for sale and price they wish to sell them for. The application will consist of an online database, where a user can make its selection and once a desired spot has been chosen in a room, they can drag and drop the product to see how it would look like. The size would be true to scale, and it would be placed in 3D. So, the user can make sure it is the right size, design, and functionality for their room. The application will have a tutorial once first downloaded, where a user can drag and drop their first furniture item as an example, which can be later accessed again if needed to along with a video and a picture tutorial by the user. The application will also have an option to scan a furniture to see what type it is and recommend similar equipment’s/ furniture up for sale on the application by the partnered furniture shops, for example, a user can scan a “chair” and it will show on the application what it is and recommend similar products for sale. The application layout will be simple and straight forward, so it is usable by people of all ages. The application will have a section where user can look at all the products up for sale so they can manually choose what to display and how many items. Users will have the option to change over the whole designated room, for example, they will be able to choose different type of lightning, wall colours, floor designs ETC. The application is mainly designed for devices which run Android 11 or later and IOS 12 or later. Any other devices will not be covered on the initial release as I don’t have the resources for it now.

																											<p>Tools and technology  </p>
																											<p>	When creating the application, I will be using hand drawn layout diagrams and then I will be using FIGMA to make the prototypes. Once the prototypes are done, I will check if they need anything such as more features etc. I will do a quick survey test to see if there is anything that the community thinks it requires or needs to be edited. Once that is done, I will be updating my prototype on FIGMA and start using Visual Studio to code application in C#. Visual studio will be used to code the online shopping system and the option to add and remove products for sale. For the AR Feature I will be using ARKIT by Apple. ARKIT combines device motion tracking, camera scene capture, advanced scene processing, and display conveniences to simplify the task of building an AR experience. ARKIT, Visual studio and FIGMA are all free, so therefore no funding is required. <div class="box alt">

																																				<p>Skills required </p>
																																				<p>	When creating interiorise, the skills I will require are mainly related to the coding section. I would need to have an idea of how to code a program which wouldn’t be an issue as I can always look up a code, I am not sure or watch a tutorial. I have also made a few apps over the past few years on visual studio using C# which are somewhat like interiorise. I will need have an understanding on ARKIT for the AR part of the project, for which I will watch a tutorial and read the information given out by ARKIT. If any more questions I can conduct a research and get the answers to the problems that might occur. A main issue I will need to work on is a Problem-solving methodology, so I can solve an issue in the code while being effective and efficient. <div class="">

																																													<p>Outcome </p>
																																													<p>	When the program is created and is successful, I will have made an application that will be used by furniture depot or individuals thinking about purchasing furniture, the application will help users choose the exact furniture they are after with a great confidence that it will look great in their home. The users will be able to scan products and find out what they are and have the option to buy similar products. Users can also look up items or go through the catalogue and use the drag and drop feature to see how the product will look like in their home. Users will have the option to buy the furniture online. The application will be cloud based which will allow the business partners to upload items for sale and customers can purchase or use the AR Feature to see how it looks. <div class="">
