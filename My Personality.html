								<p> Briggs Myers Test:  </p>
								<p>According to my Briggs Myers Test I am 75% extraverted. Which means I presser group activated and get energised by social interaction. I tend to be more enthusiastic and more easily excited than introverts. I am 54% Intuitive, which means I am very imaginative, open-minded, and curious. I prefer novelty over stability and focus on hidden meanings and future possibilities. I am emotionally expressive and sensitive.  I am empathic and less competitive than thinking types and focus on social harmony and cooperation. I am 68% judging which means I am decisive, thorough, and highly organised. They value clarity, Predictability, and closure, preferring structure and planning to spontaneity. I am 67% Assertive. Which mean self-assured, even-tempered, and resistant to stress. I refuse to worry too much and do not push myself too hard when it comes to achieving goals.

												<p> Learning Style Test </p>
												<p>According to the Learning Style Test, I understand how to be authentic and present in interpersonal interactions. I have the emotional intelligence to feel empathy and to express it. My authenticity implies that I am generous and willing to share myself with others. One of my strengths is storytelling; it is how I connect with people and engage with them in a common vision. Perhaps my greatest gift is the ability to inspire those around me to do their best.
