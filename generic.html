												<h1>Extra Detail<br />
												</h1>
												<p>My name is Muhammad Talha Imran, my friends and family call me Moey. 
													I am currently studying Bachelors of I.T. I am studying I.T because I have always been interested in working on projects and making different programs. I have a little experience with website development and a fair bit knowledge in coding. I have made several Apps in C#, 
													which helped me learn the language and I can now comfortably program in C#. Other than coding my main hobby Is working on my car, I drive a Mercedes-Benz C-Class AMG. Since a young age I have been a car enthusiast and it’s amazing to own my dream car and customise it to however, I want it to look like. Other than working on my car and University, I am usually either working or at the gym. I work in the security industry, and it is amazing. In my spare time, I like to play games mainly Forza Horizon. Overall, I am happy to be at RMIT and in future looking forward to work in Cyber Security.

															<h1>Interest in I.T<br />
															</h1>
															<p>Primary Interest: </p>
																<p>My main interest is mainly related to the Cyber Security and Artificial intelligence. In my opinion, in future these fields will grow on a great scale especially with everything around us going electric. I believe the skills I gain from I.T, will help be advance on many fields. 
																</p>
																<p>	My Background:</p>
															</p>
																I Studied Computing since year 7 and I used programs such as sketch up, scratch and python which primarily helped me develop an interest in I.T. One of the first software I made was a calculator and from there the spark grew and I ended up studying Software development in VCE. I did great in I.T and received awards for it through the school life and I enjoyed it as well as made some core memories, that’s when I realised I.T is for me, and I am studying it at RMIT. 
															</p>
															<p>My Future and why RMIT?</p>
														
																<p>Since I have started studying at RMIT, one question I have been asked the most is “Why RMIT?’ and I have answered the same way every time. I think RMIT is an amazing school especially if you are looking to study I.T. It has a wide option of courses I can choose to study from and if I am not sure about anything help is one phone call or email away. The location of the school with so many services around it makes it great especially for someone like me, who enjoys food and roaming around the city, I always have a motivation to come to university. In my time at RMIT I hope to learn about different I.T systems, major I.T fields and find exactly what I want to do with my future and pursue it. </p>
