								<h1>Cyber Security Analyst<br />
									
								</h1>
								<p> Role Description </p>
								<p>A Cyber Security Analyst role in their Security Services team is to monitor and assess diverse client IT environments to deliver an ongoing managed cyber security service. Organizations of all sizes are challenged to fully understand cyber security, not to mention having the expertise on-hand to manage cyber security effectively. Analysts on the team leverage Field Effect’s Covalence platform to find and assess anomalies and turn information from the various sensors into insights that the client can digest and act on. The team faces interesting challenges that require a blend of technical expertise with the ability to distil information and communicate effectively. In this role, I can leverage my expertise to directly help a range of clients and grow by being exposed to widely diverse and varied IT infrastructures. Threat hunting is challenging and requires broad knowledge. It can be very rewarding to help organizations defend against cyber-attacks and know that you are making a difference.</p>

												<p>	Am I eligible for this job? </p>
											</p>
											As of now, I am not eligible for the job. Although, I would be able to work in the following field if I finish Bachelors of I.T. After the bachelor’s I would hope to get a job as a junior analyst, from which I would learn to function in a working environment and gain experience by working my way up. I would hope to apply in higher fields such as cyber security analyst by using the experience I have gained and in 3-4 years after my bachelors I would be eligible for the job.
